Out Zone Free Play patch
========================

This patch adds a Free Play option to Toaplan's Out Zone. This is based on the
main ROM revision, from the set "outzone.zip".

Dependencies
------------

GNU Make, The Macro Assembler AS, and my own utility BSplit are used.

Usage
-----

Combine the two original program roms into an image called `prg.orig`, which
the assembler will then patch over. This can be done with bsplit:

`bsplit c prg1.bin prg2.bin prg.orig`

AS, on linux, is given the binary name `asl`. `asw` on Windows will work also.
At this point, call `make`. Deinterleaved binaries `prg1.bin` and `prg2.bin`
will be created. These may be burned on to 27C010 or equivelant ROMs, and
installed on an Out Zone PCB.
